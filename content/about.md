In spare time, I love photography, video games, and cats.

Below is a picture of myself taken with a [Canon EOS 550D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_550D), but now I'm using a [Fujifilm X-T5](https://fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x-t5/). I love the triple-dial design of Fujifilm X-T series, which is both asthetically pleasing and offers convenient control for users.

The Chinese characters on the mirror are 「<ruby>锲<rt>qiè</rt>而<rt>ér</rt>不<rt>bù</rt>舍<rt>shě</rt>，<rt></rt>金<rt>jīn</rt>石<rt>shí</rt>可<rt>kě</rt>镂<rt>lòu</rt></ruby>」, which means "If you persevere with chiseling, even metal and stone can be engraved". Although this phrase is often overused or even abused, it still highlights the importance of perseverance.

#### Favorite games in 2024

Action games: [Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice](https://www.activision.com/games/sekiro/sekiro-shadows-die-twice/), [Black Myth: Wukong](https://heishenhua.com/), [Another Crab's treasure](https://aggrocrab.com/ACT)
> Yes I have played [Elden Ring](https://eldenring.com), but it's not my favorite, especially [Shadow of the Erdtree](https://www.bandainamcoent.com/games/elden-ring/shadow-of-the-erdtree) :(

Strategy games: [Age of Empires 4](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/)

Other: [Tiny Glade](https://pouncelight.games/tiny-glade/)

I want to highlight Tiny Glade because one of the creators is Tomasz Stachowiak, the main contributor of [Kajiya renderer](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/kajiya). Besides the peaceful environment the game provides (which is surprisingly pleasant for anyone to stay), they've also created beautiful global illumination effects which is incredibly efficient as of 2024 that even a GTX 1060 / RX 580 GPU can run smoothly.

#### Favorite music in 2024

[サカナクション](https://sakanaction.jp/), [草東沒有派對](https://www.nopartyforcaodong.com/), [万能青年旅店](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E4%B8%87%E8%83%BD%E9%9D%92%E5%B9%B4%E6%97%85%E5%BA%97), [スタァライト九九組](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1OOP1resUwhmwUhIFtFfQN)
